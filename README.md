Reasons why we chose an app for Bus Reservation at Epoka University:
Convenience: Many university students rely on public transportation to get around campus and the surrounding area. An app that allows students to easily reserve a spot on a bus could make their lives more convenient and save them time.
Cost-effective: University students are often on a tight budget and may not be able to afford a car or other expensive modes of transportation. A bus reservation app would allow students to save money on transportation costs.
Improved efficiency: By using a bus reservation app, bus companies could better manage their schedules and routes. This would result in more efficient transportation and less time spent waiting for a bus.
Environmental benefits: By encouraging students to use public transportation, we could help reduce carbon emissions and promote a more sustainable mode of transportation.
